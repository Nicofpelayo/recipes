In this project I will build a basic webpage using html. The page will consist of some recipes I found online which will be linked below.

The objective of this project is to show my understanding of basic elements of html such as:

 - Creating the html boilerplate
 - Using the correct header levels
 - Using absolute and relative links
 - Adding images
 - Using ordered and unordered lists

Although the project is simple, it is necesary to expand my knowledge.
