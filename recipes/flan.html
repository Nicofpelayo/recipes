    <p>This flan is delicious — it's easy to make and everyone will love it!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 3 large eggs</li>
        <li> 1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li> 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li> 1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
        <li> Melt sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat until liquefied and golden in color. Carefully pour
            hot syrup into a deep 9-inch round glass baking dish, turning the dish to evenly coat the bottom; set aside.
        </li>
        <li> Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla; beat until smooth. Pour egg
            mixture on top of caramel in the baking dish; place in a deep roasting pan. Carefully pour in enough hot
            water to come 1 inch up the sides of the dish. </li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until just set with a slight jiggle in the center, about 1 hour, checking after
            55 minutes. Keep in mind the flan will continue to set as it cools. Remove from the oven and carefully
            transfer baking dish to a wire rack; cool to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap to prevent a
            skin forming. Refrigerate for 3 hours or up to 3 days. </li>
        <li> To serve, run a knife around the edges of the dish; carefully invert onto a rimmed serving plate and let
            caramel sauce flow over flan. </li>
    </ol>
